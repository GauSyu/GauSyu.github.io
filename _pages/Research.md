### Research interests

My current research mainly focus on Bruhat-Tits buildings and $p$-adic representations. 
Specifically, I am interested in studying the simplicial distance in Bruhat-Tits buildings, 
which are related to many topics such as the Moy-Prasad subgroups of a reductive group and almost self-dual lattices in a $p$-adic symplectic/orthogonal space. The larger goal is to understand the fixed-point sets in Bruhat-Tits buildings and their applications to $p$-adic representations.

For more details see my [Research Statement](/uploads/Research%20Statement.pdf)

Other interests include $p$-adic geometry, representation theory, vertex operator algebras and conformal field theory, $D$-modules and algebraic analysis, tensor triangular geometry, higher category theory and homotopical algebras, Diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory, etc.
