### Research interesting

My current research focuses on \$p\$-adic representations and Bruhat-Tits buildings. More precisely, I'm interested in the stable simplices in the Bruhat-Tits building obtained from a $p$-adic representation.
Other interests include $p$-adic geometry, transcendental number theory, D-modules, homotopical algebras, and higher category theory.
