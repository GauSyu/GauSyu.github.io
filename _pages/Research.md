### Research interesting

My current research focuses on p-adic representations and Bruhat-Tits buildings. More precisely, I'm interested in the stable simplices in the Bruhat-Tits building obtained from a p-adic representation.

Other interests include algebraic topology, chiral algebras, D-modules, higher category theory, homotopical algebras, mathematical physics, p-adic geometry, representation theory, transcendental number theory, etc.
