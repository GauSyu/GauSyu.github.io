### Academic Talks

- **$p$-进表示与Bruhat-Tits建筑中的单形距离**      
  *珠海代数组合研讨会*，中山大学，珠海，October 29, 2023. [(Slides)](https://github.com/GauSyu/MathSlides/raw/main/p-adic%20repns%20and%20simplicial%20distance.Zhuhai.pdf)

- **$p$-进表示与Bruhat-Tits建筑中的单形距离**      
  *第18届全国李理论会议*，同济大学，上海，July 21, 2023. [(Slides)](https://github.com/GauSyu/MathSlides/raw/main/p-adic%20repns%20and%20simplicial%20distance.Shanghai.pdf)

- **$p$-adic representations and simplicial balls in Bruhat-Tis buildings**      
  *AMS Special Session on Combinatorics and Representation Theory, Spring Western Sectional Meeting*, May 6, 2023. [(Slides)](https://github.com/GauSyu/MathSlides/raw/main/p-adic%20repns%20and%20simplicial%20distance.short.pdf)

		<blockquote>
  	$p$-adic representations are important objects in number theory, and stable lattices serve as a connection between the study of ordinary and modular representations. These stable lattices can be understood as stable vertices in Bruhat-Tits buildings. From this viewpoint, the study of fixed point sets in these buildings can aid research on -adic representations. The simplicial balls, in particular, hold an important role as they possess the most symmetry and fastest growth, and are closely related to the Moy-Prasad filtrations. In this talk, I will introduce some results on simplicial balls.

These stable lattices can be understood as stable vertices in Bruhat-Tits buildings. From this viewpoint, the study of fixed point sets in these buildings can aid research on $-adic representations. The simplicial distance holds an important role as it connects the combinatorics of lattices and the geometry of root systems. In particularly, the fixed-point sets of Moy-Prasad subgroups are precisely the simplicial balls. In this talk, I'll explain those findings and compute their simplicial volume under certain conditions.
