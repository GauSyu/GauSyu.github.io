  	<u><b>Abstract</b></u> (click me)
  	</summary> 	$p$-adic representations are important objects in number theory, and stable lattices serve as a connection between the study of ordinary and modular representations. These stable lattices can be understood as stable vertices in Bruhat-Tits buildings. From this viewpoint, the study of fixed point sets in these buildings can aid research on p-adic representations. The simplicial balls, in particular, hold an important role as they possess the most symmetry and fastest growth, and are closely related to the Moy-Prasad filtrations. In this talk, I'll explain those new findings, provide a characterization of such simplicial balls, and compute their simplicial volume under certain conditions.
