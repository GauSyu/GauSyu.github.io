Hi! This is Xu Gao (a.k.a. Syu Gau),<br>
a Mathematical postdoc at Tongji University.
</font>*

I have a wide range of interests in mathematics: $p$-adic geometry, representation theory, vertex operator algebras and conformal field theory, $D$-modules and algebraic analysis, tensor triangular geometry, higher category theory and homotopical algebras, complex algebraic geometry and transcendental number theory, etc. 

Before moving to Tongji, I completed my Ph.D. degree at UC Santa Cruz on June 2023. My disseration focuses on Bruhat-Tits buildings and $p$-adic representations under the supervision of [Junecue Suh](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=jusuh). In addition, I study vertex operator algebras and chiral algebras under the supervision of [Chongying Dong](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=dong).

Before moving to UCSC, I received my master degree at [Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/) under the advice of [Chengming Bai](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/info/1142/1295.htm), studying pre-Lie algebras and Rota-Baxter operators.
