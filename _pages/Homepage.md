### *Hi! This is Xu Gao (a.k.a. Syu Gau),<br> a PhD candidate in mathematics at<br> University of California, Santa Cruz.*

I have a wide range of interests in mathematics: algebraic analysis, mathematical physics, representation theory, p-adic geometry, tensor triangular geometry, higher category theory, homotopical algebras, transcendental number theory, etc. 

At present, my research focuses on Bruhat-Tits buildings and p-adic representations under the advice of [Junecue Suh](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=jusuh). More precisely, I'm considering simplicial balls in Bruhat-Tits buildings. The larger goal is to understand the fixed-point sets in Bruhat-Tits buildings and their applications to p-adic representations.

Before moving to UCSC, I received my master degree at [Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/) under the advice of [Chengming Bai](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/info/1142/1295.htm).
