### *Hi! This is Xu Gao,<br> a PhD candidate in mathematics at<br> University of California, Santa Cruz.*

I have a wide range of interests in mathematics: number theory, algebraic geometry, representation theory, algebraic topology, category theory, etc. At present, my research focuses on p-adic representations and Bruhat-Tits buildings. More precisely, I'm interested in the stable simplices in the Bruhat-Tits building obtained from a p-adic representation.
