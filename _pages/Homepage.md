### *Hi! This is Xu Gao,<br> a PhD candidate in mathematics at<br> University of California, Santa Cruz.*

I have a wide range of interests in mathematics: algebraic topology, chiral algebras, D-modules, higher category theory, homotopical algebras, mathematical physics, p-adic geometry, representation theory, transcendental number theory, etc. 

At present, my research focuses on p-adic representations and Bruhat-Tits buildings under the advice of [Junecue Suh](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=jusuh). More precisely, I'm interested in the stable simplices in the Bruhat-Tits building obtained from a p-adic representation.
