Hi! This is Xu Gao (a.k.a. Syu Gau),<br>
a Mathematical postdoc.
</font>*

I have completed my Ph.D. degree and graduated from UC Santa Cruz on June 2023.

I have a wide range of interests in mathematics: $p$-adic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics, algebraic analysis, tensor triangular geometry, higher category theory, homotopical algebras, transcendental number theory, etc. 

At present, my research focuses on Bruhat-Tits buildings and p-adic representations under the advice of [Junecue Suh](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=jusuh). More precisely, I'm studying simplicial distance in Bruhat-Tits buildings. The larger goal is to understand the fixed-point sets in Bruhat-Tits buildings and their applications to $p$-adic representations.

Before moving to UCSC, I received my master degree at [Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/) under the advice of [Chengming Bai](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/info/1142/1295.htm), studying pre-Lie algebras.
