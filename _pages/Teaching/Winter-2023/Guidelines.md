- [Glossary](#glossary)

- [Midterm](#midterm)
- [Final](#final)
- [Communication](#communication)
- [$\\LaTeX$](#latex)
- [Online Discussion Tools](#online-discussion-tools)


#### Attendance and Quizzes

1.  The lectures are *mandatory*, so there will be an attendance record.

2.  At the *beginning* of a lecture, you will see a QR code. Scan it to complete the attendance form. This is also the place to submit your quiz answer (if there is a quiz). You can also use this form to give your feedback on this lecture. The QR code will appear again at the *end* of the lecture.

3.  If you cannot attend, please *contact me before the lecture* to avoid losing attendance points.

4.  There may or may not be a quiz during the lecture. Submit your answer *through the attendance form*.

#### Glossary

1.  Throughout the course, you will maintain a glossary of terms and results that you find difficult to digest or wish to remember. Add *your thoughts* on them, and whenever possible, include examples as well.

2.  The glossary can be typed or handwritten, long or short, but it *cannot be empty*. The point is it is about your learning experience.

3.  You are asked to share your glossary every month (before the exams). To do this, navigate to the Glossary page and upload a *PDF* file to Gradescope. Be aware of the *due date*.

4.  You can use the glossary as an *index* to resources you need to solve problems in the exams.

#### Homework

1.  There will be homework every week. Please turn in the homework on the *due date*. (If you need an extension, please ask before the due date.)

2.  You are encouraged to *discuss* the problems with your peers (for example, on ED Discuss). However, you must write the homework *by yourself* using your words and *acknowledge your collaborators*.

3.  The homework is expected to be typed using *LaTeX*.

4.  Pay close attention to the presentation and the clarity of your reasoning. This course is writing-intensive.

5.  List the *references* you have used in your answer. You should avoid using resources that solve the problem immediately.

6.  To submit the homework, navigate to the Homework page and upload the *compiled PDF* file (not the .tex file) to Gradescope.


#### Midterm

1.  The Midterms will be given on *Monday, Jan. 30th* and *Monday, Feb. 27th* during the lecture times.

2.  Please prepare draft papers before the exam.

3.  You can use your glossary, notes, textbook, and homework during the exam. But you *cannot discuss* the problems with others. *No digital devices* are allowed during the exam.

4.  The only results (theorems/lemmas) you’re allowed to use are either provided during the lectures or in the exercises/homework.


#### Final

1.  According to [the registrar](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/soc/final-examinations.html), the Final will be given on *Thursday, March 23 12:00 – 3:00 PM*.

2.  You can look up your glossary, notes, textbook, and homework during the exam. But you *cannot discuss* the problems with others. *No digital devices* are allowed during the exam.

3.  The only results (theorems/lemmas) you’re allowed to use are either provided during the lectures or in the exercises/homework.

4.  If you have any questions, ask me or the TA.


#### Communication

1.  You are welcome to ask me any questions during class and the office hours.

2.  Besides those times, please contact me primarily via *Canvas*. I will reply within 24 hours during the weekdays. Contact me via email if and only if you haven’t received any response for a long time.

3.  When you contact me, please provide as much information as possible on the subject you intend to discuss.

4.  *Never hesitate to reach out*.

#### $\LaTeX$ 

1.  $\LaTeX$ is widely used for mathematical writing. You will need basic $\LaTeX$ for this course. 
2.  To start, look at the *.tex files* I provide you. You can upload them to online $\LaTeX$ editors such as
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), or import them into a local editor. Then google anything beyond the files, and use the online resources such as [Tex Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), [Overleaf knowledge base](https://www.overleaf.com/learn), and [$\LaTeX$ wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX). If you need help getting started, please contact me.



#### Online Discussion Tools

We will use online discussion tools such as discord. You are encouraged to collaborate and answer each other’s questions. You can find more details on Canvas.
