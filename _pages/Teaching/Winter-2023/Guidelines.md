#### Attendance and Quizzes

1.  The lectures are *mandatory*, so there will be an attendance record.

2.  At the *beginning* of a lecture, you will see a QR code. Scan it to complete the attendance form. This is also the place to submit your quiz answer (if there is a quiz). You can also use this form to give your feedback on this lecture. The QR code will appear again at the *end* of the lecture.

3.  If you cannot attend, please *contact me before the lecture* to avoid losing attendance points.

4.  There may or may not be a quiz during the lecture. Submit your answer *through the attendance form*.

#### Glossary

1.  Throughout the course, you will maintain a glossary of terms and results that you find difficult to digest or wish to remember. Add *your thoughts* on them, and whenever possible, include examples as well.

2.  The glossary can be typed or handwritten, long or short, but it *cannot be empty*. The point is it is about your learning experience.

3.  You are asked to share your glossary every month (before the exams). To do this, navigate to the Glossary page and upload a *PDF* file to Gradescope. Be aware of the *due date*.

4.  You can use the glossary as an *index* to resources you need to solve problems in the exams.
