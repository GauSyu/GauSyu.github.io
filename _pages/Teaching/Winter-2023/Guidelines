#### Attendance and Quizzes

1.  The lectures are *mandatory*, so there will be an attendance record.

2.  At the *beginning* of a lecture, you will see a QR code. Scan it to complete the attendance form. This is also the place to submit your quiz answer (if there is a quiz). You can also use this form to give your feedback on this lecture. The QR code will appear again at the *end* of the lecture.

3.  If you cannot attend, please *contact me before the lecture* to avoid losing attendance points.

4.  There may or may not be a quiz during the lecture. Submit your answer *through the attendance form*.
