This course consists of the following components:

#### Lectures (recorded)

They serve as the main learning materials for this course.

- Recorded videos of the lectures will be uploaded to Canvas for students to access at their convenience.
- Mandatory quizzes will be integrated into the lectures to assess understanding and encourage active learning.
- Quizzes will be graded either by completion or with unlimited attempts.

#### Supplementary Materials

Along with the recorded lectures, additional materials relevant to each lecture will be provided.

- These materials include historical notes, terminology explanations, online resources, and additional content that may not be fully covered in the lecture.
- You are encouraged to explore these materials and use them as references in your assignments, exams, and essays.

#### Glossary

Throughout the course, you will maintain a glossary of terms and results that you find difficult to digest or wish to remember.

- Add your thoughts on them, and whenever possible, include examples as well.
- Submit your glossary as a PDF file to Gradescope before the Final.
- The glossary can be used as an index to resources for solving exam problems.

#### Exercises

Attached to each lecture and some supplementary notes, there will be short questions named exercises for practice and self-assessment.

- Exercises are not mandatory: they will not be collected or graded.
- However, they are highly recommended as they help reinforce understanding of lecture topics and practice important methods.
- The difficulty of exercises is between quizzes and homework problems.

#### Homework

There will be a total of four weekly homework assignments.

- Collaborative discussions with peers are encouraged. However, you must write the solutions in your own words and acknowledge collaborators.
- Homework is expected to be typed using LaTeX.
- Pay close attention to clear and well-reasoned writing.
- References used in homework answers should be listed (either manually or using BibTeX). Immediate problem-solving resources should be avoided.
- Submissions should be compiled into a PDF file and uploaded to Gradescope.
- The specific grading policy will be determined by the TA.

#### Exam

There will be one take-home final exam.

- The exam will contain 7-9 problems, with an estimated time of 5 hours for completion.
- It will be released at the beginning of the last week and due at the end of the session.
- Only results (theorems/lemmas/propositions/examples) provided during the lectures or in the homework are allowed for reference.
- Solutions should be handwritten on the exam paper. You can upload either a scanned copy or an annotated PDF file.
- Before submitting the final exam, ensure that your solutions are well-reasoned, and your writing is clear and legible.
- If you have any questions, please reach out to me or the TA for assistance.

#### Essay

The ability to present mathematical reasoning in a clear and organized manner through mathematical writing is a skill that requires training. This is also one of the objectives of this course.

- In the middle of the course, you will be provided with a sample essay. Your task is to complete it by filling in the missing steps or details.
- Afterward, you need to choose a topic related to number theory and write your own essay, following the format of the provided sample.
- Essays are expected to be typed using LaTeX.
- The purpose of the essay is to practice mathematical writing. While originality is not a requirement, it is essential to adhere to academic integrity, write clearly, and acknowledge collaboration and references.

#### Discussion Sections

Discussion sections will provide students with an opportunity to ask questions, review challenging concepts, and engage in collaborative problem-solving.

- These sessions will be conducted by the TA.
- For further details, please consult with the TA.

#### Communication

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.



- Please reach out to me primarily through Canvas messages. If you prefer to email me, please start the subject line with "Math110".
- Provide as much information as possible regarding the topic you wish to discuss.
- I will respond within 24 hours on weekdays, but please note that there may be delays during the weekend. Also, remember to check Canvas for any updates.
- Don't hesitate to reach out.

#### LaTeX 

1.  $\LaTeX$ is widely used for mathematical writing. You will need basic $\LaTeX$ for this course. 
2.  To start, look at the **.tex files** I provide you. 
3.  Google anything beyond the files, and use online resources such as [Tex Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), [Overleaf knowledge base](https://www.overleaf.com/learn), and [$\LaTeX$ wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX). 
4.  I will provide **solution shells** for each homework. Upload them to an online $\LaTeX$ IDE such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and start typing your solutions.
5.  Or you can import them into a local $\LaTeX$ IDE. To know more about getting LaTeX locally on your laptops, see [The TUG beginning page](https://www.tug.org/begin.html). (Note that as of 2022, proTeXt has been retired permanently. You can use [TeX Live on Windows](https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html) instead.)
6.  If you need help getting started, please contact me ([Guidelines for Communication](#communication)).
